- fix edge artefacts on platform sprites:
  - this is currently fixed by changing texture filtering to nearest instead of linear;
    this is ok, but if it needs to be changed another solution for artefacts will need to be found
  - some posts regarding this issue: http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/bleeding/26823/msg/237162/view.html#msg237162

- change adding to visible/active platform list
  - use wider area, so that vertical moving platforms don't become inactive when the move from 
    the visible screen and so that moving platforms become active before user can see them
    
- platform movement:
  - add particles for engine
  - if necessary change and/or animate engine sprite
  
- background:
  - add bottom hell image with lava rivers and volcano in perspective
    - maybe also animate colors
  
- platform additions:
  - jump boost in form of geothermal vent or whatever on
    - should activate on collision with pad when collided in area where that boost is
  - spikes on platform, or flame on platform
    - only part of platform
    - entire platform going up and down (turning on and for), perhaps more time off than on
      - maybe even with a small timer that says when change occurs, or maybe some animation
        prior to turning on
