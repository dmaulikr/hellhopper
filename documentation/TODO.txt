- use different in game units, like 40px equals 1m

- change adding to visible/active platform list
  - use wider area, so that vertical moving platforms don't become inactive when the move from 
    the visible screen and so that moving platforms become active before user can see them
    
- platform movement:
  - add particles for engine
  - if necessary change and/or animate engine sprite
  
- background:
  - add bottom hell image with lava rivers and volcano in perspective
    - maybe also animate colors

- make portal with flame square for character
  - when he jumps move screen with eased in/out interpolation to the new location
  
- platform additions:
  - jump boost in form of geothermal vent or whatever on
    - should activate on collision with pad when collided in area where that boost is
  - spikes on platform, or flame on platform
    - only part of platform
    - entire platform going up and down (turning on and for), perhaps more time off than on
      - maybe even with a small timer that says when change occurs, or maybe some animation
        prior to turning on
