- black box:
  - random powerup or disability
- powerups:
  - beans
    - causes n farts that continuously propel player
    - make sure that farts don't stop on a place where there is no platform between player and bottom of the screen (jump boost sections)
  - 
       
- implement a mechanic where you need to jump on specific platforms in specific order
  (which can be random) to generate a platform above to jump on and continue going up
  - possibly have 4-5 platforms on the same step and then randomly turn the platform to green
    color so player knows on which to jump

- maybe:
  - use separate camera for gui and game
    - try making gui camera same as physical resolution
    - add class for selecting fonts - for example you want font that is 5% screen height,
      then take height, multiply by 0.05 and return font that is closest to that size
