- black box:
  - random powerup or disability
       
- implement a mechanic where you need to jump on specific platforms in specific order
  (which can be random) to generate a platform above to jump on and continue going up
  - possibly have 4-5 platforms on the same step and then randomly turn the platform to green
    color so player knows on which to jump
    
- implement platforms where you need to jump on specific platform part to move it in certain direction

- implement section with movable platform and an obstacle above with timed removal (or same thing with platform appearing)

- implement spikes under platform
  - should be drawn in three directions to indicate that any contact will kill character (contact from up is impossible because of platform)
  - implement separate sections with normal, with reposition and with moving platforms with spikes underneath
  
- maybe increase visible on jump and crumble platform fraction for their sections

- maybe:
  - use separate camera for gui and game
    - try making gui camera same as physical resolution
    - add class for selecting fonts - for example you want font that is 5% screen height,
      then take height, multiply by 0.05 and return font that is closest to that size
