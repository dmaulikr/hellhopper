- implement game area segment reader:
  - xml file
  - <gameareasegment steprange="<int>" difficulty="<int>">{1}
    - <pad stepx="<int>" stepy="<int>">{1..n}
      - <properties>
        - <property name="<name>" value="<value>">{0..n}
 
      
- implement different pad types: 
  - pads moving horizontaly
    - speed, movement range
  - pads moving vertically
    - speed, movement range
  - pads moving in circle
  
- platform additions:
  - jump boost in form of geothermal vent or whatever on
    - should activate on collision with pad when collided in area where that boost is
  - spikes on platform, or flame on platform
    - only part of platform
    - entire platform going up and down (turning on and for), perhaps more time off than on
      - maybe even with a small timer that says when change occurs, or maybe some animation
        prior to turning on
