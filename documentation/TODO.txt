- change platform architecture
  - don't use inheritance, use some kind of composition and add properties to platform
  - properties: flame, jump boost, crumble etc.
  
- background:
  - add bottom hell image with lava rivers and volcano in perspective
    - maybe also animate colors

- make portal with flame square for character
  - when he jumps move screen with eased in/out interpolation to the new location
       

- rise sections:
  - all horizontal moving platforms, one on each step, 0.1 jump boost chance
  
- platform types:
  - normal
  - visible on touch
  - crumble
  - moving
  - irratic moving
       
- implement a mechanic where you need to jump on specific platforms in specific order
  (which can be random) to generate a platform above to jump on and continue going up
  - possibly have 4-5 platforms on the same step and then randomly turn the platform to green
    color so player knows on which to jump

- maybe:
  - use separate camera for gui and game
    - try making gui camera same as physical resolution
    - add class for selecting fonts - for example you want font that is 5% screen height,
      then take height, multiply by 0.05 and return font that is closest to that size
      
- fire composition:
0 3 2 1 4
1 4 3 2 0
2 0 4 3 1
3 1 0 4 2
4 2 1 0 3

2 0 4 3
3 1 0 4
4 2 1 0
0 3 2 1
1 4 3 2
