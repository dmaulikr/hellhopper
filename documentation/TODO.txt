- change platform architecture
  - don't use inheritance, use some kind of composition and add properties to platform
  - properties: horz, vert or circ movable, flame, jump boost, crumble etc.
    
- platform movement:
  - add particles for engine
  - if necessary change and/or animate engine sprite
  
- background:
  - add bottom hell image with lava rivers and volcano in perspective
    - maybe also animate colors

- make portal with flame square for character
  - when he jumps move screen with eased in/out interpolation to the new location
  
- platform additions:
  - jump boost in form of geothermal vent or whatever on
    - should activate on collision with pad when collided in area where that boost is
  - spikes on platform, or flame on platform
    - only part of platform
    - entire platform going up and down (turning on and for), perhaps more time off than on
      - maybe even with a small timer that says when change occurs, or maybe some animation
        prior to turning on
        
- maybe:
  - use different in game units, like 40px equals 1m
  - use separate camera for gui and game
    - try making gui camera same as physical resolution
    - add class for selecting fonts - for example you want font that is 5% screen height,
      then take height, multiply by 0.05 and return font that is closest to that size
      
- add spacing in font images for suchy blocks and hell hopper games to see if this prevents
  antialiasing artefacts in fonts
