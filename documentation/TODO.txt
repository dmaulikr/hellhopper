- implement alpha for crumble platform
  - this will probably be simplest if i convert all platforms textures to sprites
- change adding to visible/active platform list
  - use wider area, so that vertical moving platforms don't become inactive when the move from 
    the visible screen and so that moving platforms become active before user can see them
  
- platform additions:
  - jump boost in form of geothermal vent or whatever on
    - should activate on collision with pad when collided in area where that boost is
  - spikes on platform, or flame on platform
    - only part of platform
    - entire platform going up and down (turning on and for), perhaps more time off than on
      - maybe even with a small timer that says when change occurs, or maybe some animation
        prior to turning on
