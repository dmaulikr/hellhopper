Hell Hopper
===========

This is a game where player jumps on platforms to go as high as possible without falling (like [Doodle Jump](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lima.doodlejump)).
It is a really simple game, and probably nowhere near as interesting as Doodle Jump, but it is finished and playable.
It was created with the help of [LibGdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

You can download it from [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turbogerm.helljump).
You can also find some screenshots and links related to the game [here](http://goranm.com/portfolio/hellhopper).

All the graphics exept platform flame were also created by me. They are not too pretty, but if you still want to use it, you can do so under the same conditions as the code.

I either modified or used the work of these people as integral parts for the resulting images/sounds that are in the game (so if some of them suck, you could still probably blame me for messing up their work :)). If you want to use these please check their original licenses.
